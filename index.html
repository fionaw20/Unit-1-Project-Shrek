<h1> All About Shrek </h1>
<h3> By Fiona Wong </h3>

<p> <strong><em>Shrek is a fictional ogre  character created by American author William Steig in the Shrek film series by DreamWorks Animation, as well as a musical.</em></strong> <br> </p> 

      <p> Once upon a time, in a far away swamp, there lived an ogre named <strong>Shrek <em>(Mike Myers)</em></strong> whose precious solitude is suddenly shattered by an invasion of annoying fairy tale characters. They were all banished from their kingdom by the evil <strong>Lord Farquaad <em>(John Lithgow)</em></strong>. Determined to save their home -- not to mention his -- Shrek cuts a deal with Farquaad and sets out to rescue <strong>Princess Fiona <em>(Cameron Diaz)</em></strong> to be Farquaad's bride. Rescuing the Princess may be small compared to her deep, dark secret. <br> </p>
